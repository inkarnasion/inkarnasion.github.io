                    </header>
                    <p>The Sophia-bot was dreamed up by the brains at Hanson Robotics, lead by AI developer David Hanson.  In his published paper, upending the Uncanny Valley he extrapolates on how humanoid robots can be likable, despite the conception that anything to 'fake human' will trigger a revulsion in people. "We feel that for realistic robots to be appealing to people, robots must attain some level of integrated social responsivity and aesthetic refinement," he wrote. "Rendering the social human in all possible detail can help us to better understand social intelligence, both scientifically and artistically

                    </header>
                    <p>The course’s objective is to prepare specialists in the field of innovative modern technologies in wind energetics and implement the concept of sustainable development for science research and practical business purposes.
                        The main goal of the Wind Energetics program is to educate the students for gaining practical skills during the course through working on various projects and preparation of the master thesis on practically applicable themes.
                        To apply for Master in Wind Energetics, student must have BSc in polytechnics or engineering, higher education recognized in EU and a good command of English.
                        THe Wind Energetics master Programme includes a comprehensive training in the field of the design, building and operation of wind-power electrical systems, acquires a research based competence in the wind energy area, acquires knowledge of fundamental theories and methods used in the subject, attains theoretical and practical skills required for wind turbine planning and design, develops technical skills related to the design, analysis, specification and evaluation of complex wind turbine projects.
                        Main subjects in Wind Energetics master Programme:
                        •    Wind generators;
                        •    Computational fluid dynamics and dynamics of structures;
                        •    Wind turbine design;
                        •    Electric machines in wind energy conversion;
                        •    Wind electric generation schemes;
                        •    Management system of wind energy supplier;
                        •    Monitoring, control and diagnostic of wind generator;
                        •    Experimental methods for data measurement;
                        •    Results treatment and errors reduction;
                        •    Environmental impacts of wind technology;
                        •    Ecological requirements related to wind generators construction;
                        •    European legislation.
                        Elective disciplines for graduated engineers:
                        •    Measurement and certification;
                        •    Wind resources and loads on wind turbines;
                        •    Introduction to numerical modeling of wind turbine structures;
                        •    Optimization methods;
                        •    Aeroelastic design of wind turbines;
                        •    Design and manufacturing of wind turbine rotor blades;
                        •    Composite materials for wind turbine rotor blades;
                        •    Wind power farm design-regulatory documents and optimization.
                        The graduates from Wind Energetics master program  get a Master-engineer in Wind energetics  degrre and they can realize themselves as professionals in various fields of energetics (and in particular in the area of the Renewable Energy Sources and the Energy Efficiency) as: designers and constructors of electrical energy systems; scientists and lecturers; representatives at state and municipal administrations and at non-governmental organizations; leaders of wind management platforms or wind farms; private entrepreneurs, etc.
